# Face Recognition Based Attendance System 
install opencv and tkinter in anaconda and run attendance.py and enjoy.
just make a folder named TrainingImageLabel.

Automatic face recognition (AFR) technologies
have made many improvements in the changing world. Smart
Attendance using Real-Time Face Recognition is a real-world
solution which comes with day to day activities of handling
student attendance system. Face recognition-based attendance
system is a process of recognizing the students face for taking
attendance by using face biometrics based on high - definition
monitor video and other information technology. In my face
recognition project, a computer system will be able to find and
recognize human faces fast and precisely in images or videos that
are being captured through a surveillance camera. Numerous
algorithms and techniques have been developed for improving
the performance of face recognition but the concept to be
implemented here is Deep Learning. It helps in conversion of the
frames of the video into images so that the face of the student can
be easily recognized for their attendance so that the attendance
database can be easily reflected automatically.
